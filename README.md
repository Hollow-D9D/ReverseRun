# Reverse_Run

# First finished project of CREO.
# Our team had fun working on this game, as it involved ragdoll manipulations.
# Our team had to deal with rope mechanics, ragdoll mechanics, humanoid animations, physical forces, raycast, line rendering, and small amount of shader manipulations.
# Also we made custom particle effects to polish the game.
